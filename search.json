In China, the mobility behaviour response to the COVID-19 pandemic at the intra-city levels is largely unknown, mainly due to a lack of individual-level publicly available mobility data.\nGlobally, the Google Community Mobility Report provides a percentage change in place visit frequencies in six types of locations to help understand peopleâ€™s social activities within cities, but this dataset does not include mainland China.\nHere, using 210 million geotagged posts from 10 million users in Weibo social media platform, our team provides fine-grained mobility data describing the daily percentage change in visits to functional amenities in China during 2020 compared to the baseline in 2019.\n\n\n\n\nThe fine-grained mobility data could supplement the available city-level mobility metrics and fill the gap in Google Community Mobility Report in mainland China.\nWith this prior knowledge, governments can formulate corresponding policies for economic recovery, provide post-epidemic assistance to specific groups in need, and be well-prepared for the next global emergency.\nUsing massive geotagged social media data\n\nPercentage change in number of visits to specific places in China during 2020\nNon-residential or Residential places\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix categories of places\n\nResidentialWorkplacesRetail & recreationParksTransit stationsGrocery & pharmacy"
