    "text": "Data\nCOVID-19 caused widespread disruption to normal lives and human activities. In China, the mobility behaviour response to the COVID-19 pandemic at the intra-city levels is largely unknown, mainly due to a lack of individual-level publicly available mobility data.\nGlobally, the Google Community Mobility Report provides a percentage change in place visit frequencies in six types of locations to help understand people’s social activities within cities, but this dataset does not include mainland China.\nHere, using 210 million geotagged posts from 10 million users in Weibo social media platform, our team provides fine-grained mobility data describing the daily percentage change in visits to functional amenities in China during 2020 compared to the baseline in 2019.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nOur data is probably the first mobility dataset depicting the diverse mobility response in China during the pandemic from the perspective of amenities.\nThe data shows the changes in visits to six categories of places: Residential, Workplaces, Retail & recreation, Parks, Transit stations, and Grocery & pharmacy.\nThe fine-grained mobility data could supplement the available city-level mobility metrics and fill the data gap in Google Community Mobility Report in mainland China.\nThe data could help design targeted policies to promote outdoor activities and stimulate economic recovery.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in visits to six categories of places in China during 2020\n\n\nResidentialWorkplacesRetail & recreationParksTransit stationsGrocery & pharmacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Start of the Chunyun period  B: Announcement of COVID-19 human-to-human transmission  C: All provinces in mainland China (except Tibet) launched the highest level of emergency responses  D: 18 provinces lowered the level of emergency response  a: New Year’s Day  b: the Spring Festival  c: Tomb-sweeping Day  d: May Day  e: the Dragon Boat Festival  f: National Holiday & Mid-autumn Festival\n\n\n\n\nChanges in visits to residential/non-residential places in China during 2020\n\nTo understand how people balanced their outdoor activities and stay-at-home choices, five non-residential categories (Workplaces, Retail & recreation, Parks, Transit stations, and Grocery & pharmacy) are aggregated into one category and then calculated the corresponding percentage change in the number of visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Start of the Chunyun period  B: Announcement of COVID-19 human-to-human transmission  C: All provinces in mainland China (except Tibet) launched the highest level of emergency responses  D: 18 provinces lowered the level of emergency response  a: New Year’s Day  b: the Spring Festival  c: Tomb-sweeping Day  d: May Day  e: the Dragon Boat Festival  f: National Holiday & Mid-autumn Festival\n\n \n\n\n\nAbout data\n\nData source\n\nThe fine-grained mobility data is aggregated from 210 million geotagged posts uploaded by 10 million Weibo users from 2019 to 2020. Weibo (https://weibo.com), the Chinese version of Twitter, is the most widely used social media platform in China, with 582 million active users in the second quarter of 2022 (41% penetration of the China population). The Weibo social media platform allows users to share their geographical location by posting POIs. Specific POIs can be used to determine the detailed address and geographical coordinates of the sites visited by users.\n\n\n\nData process\n\n\nReferring to the taxonomy of Google Community Mobility Report (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/), the POIs attached to posts were grouped into six categories (Residential, Workplaces, Retail & recreation, Parks, Transit stations, and Grocery & pharmacy) based on their social attributes.\nCounting the daily visits to these categories of places for each cities.\nSmoothing the daily visits by the method of 7-day moving average.\nCalculating the percentage change for each day by comparing it to a pre-pandemic baseline value for that same day of the week estimated over the second half of 2019.\n\n\n\n\nData description\n\nThe mobility data fields are described as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nct_adcode\ncity code\n\n\ncity_ch\ncity name (Chinese)\n\n\ncity_en\ncity name (English)\n\n\npr_adcode\nprovince code\n\n\npr_ch\nprovince name (Chinese)\n\n\npr_en\nprovince name (English)\n\n\ncreated_at\ndate\n\n\ncategory\nsix categories of places (Residential, Workplaces, Retail & recreation, Parks, Transit stations, and Grocery & pharmacy)\n\n\nvisits_7MA_percentage_change\npercentage change in number of visits compared to baseline days\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDownload\nhttps://github.com/CASGIS/Socialmedia_Mobility/tree/main/publication/geotagged_data\n \n\n\nHow to cite\nUsing these data should cite: Zhu, K., Cheng, Z. & Wang, J.
